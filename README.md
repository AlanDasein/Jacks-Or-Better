Game of JACKS OR BETTER made with Javascript
-------------------------------------------------------------

Javascript code is managed trough the jQuery Library. 
Style is handled with pure css, the cards are shown with unicode characters. 
No Assets like images. The only image include (the pattern for the card cover) is created with css. 
A future implementation could be adding audio file resources hosted online to keep avoiding the use of external files. 
There are two fonts included from the google fonts library available online. 
The game can be opened while working offline but the fonts for the cards and the other one won't be accesible. 
A minimized version is include. The game is completely encapsulated in a single file in that minimized version.
